# blaise

`blaise` is an interpretor for a french pascal-flavored pseudocode.

## Is it any good?

No.
The code is terrible, it leaks a lot of memory, the error messages are bad
if there are any at all, and it crashes if you look at it funny.

## Licensing

`blaise` is released under the GNU General Public License version 3,
or (at your option) any later version.
